Being an only child meant most of your early conversations and decisions happened with adults, which pushed you toward speaking with certainty and holding your ground in discussions. Extended family lived nearby, so gatherings were frequent, often centering on food, music, and friendly teasing, which taught you both pride in your heritage and confidence in social settings. You learned early that you could win respect by sounding sure of yourself, even when you felt uncertain inside.  \n\nIn adolescence, you carried that assertiveness into school and your first jobs, sometimes clashing with supervisors when you thought they were wrong. You also discovered your patience in mentoring younger kids, whether helping a cousin with homework or showing a neighbor’s child how to fix a bike. Trade school strengthened your interest in electrical work, and you gravitated toward the hands-on satisfaction of solving technical problems. Overthinking details became a habit in wiring projects, shop assignments, and eventually on job sites—something coworkers often appreciated for safety’s sake but that could make you slow to reach decisions.  \n\nAs an adult, you’ve built a stable life in the suburbs with your spouse and children. You manage bills reliably but rarely put away much beyond essentials, which sometimes leaves you uneasy about unexpected expenses. Your style at work tends toward taking charge, especially on solo projects, but you relax into collaboration during creative troubleshooting. At home, you find joy in playing with your kids and teaching them small skills, though you notice you talk more easily about facts and plans than about what’s bothering you. Attempts at mindfulness or wellness routines start strong, then fade, leaving you with the sense that you could connect more fully to your emotions if you stayed consistent.  \n\nLately, the gap between what you feel and what you share has been more evident to you. You don’t struggle with persistent anxiety or depression, but you sometimes realize that even people close to you don’t know the full picture of your thoughts or moods. You want to be able to express feelings without worrying about whether they come across as weakness or distraction, especially with your spouse and children. That desire—to make your inner life more visible in everyday moments—has led you to seek support and tools to communicate your emotions better.", "chat_username": "PT_2_898399045686977022_regular_2", "chat_password": "PT_2_898399045686977022_regular_2", "argilla_id": "PT_2", "intake_summary": "# Reason for Joining & Key Symptoms\n\nPrimary Motivation: Brandon joined the program to improve his ability to communicate his emotions more effectively.  \n\nKey Symptoms: Tends to overthink details, experiences occasional worry, inconsistent adherence to wellness routines, sometimes struggles to express feelings clearly.\n\n# Member's Goal\n\nPrimary Goal: Learn how to better express feelings, build consistency in personal wellness routines, maintain emotional balance.\n\n# Medical History & Risk Factors\nNo known medical or mental health diagnoses; no significant physical limitations or red flags reported.\n\n# Routine & Lifestyle Insights\nWorks full time as an electrician, lives with spouse and children, moderately active with regular but not intense exercise, typically sleeps 7–8 hours per night with good quality, enjoys family support, resides in a suburban environment, engages in wellness or mindfulness sporadically without long-term consistency.\n\n# Top 3 Priorities\n- Support Brandon in developing emotional expression skills through practical, daily exercises.  \n- Help build and sustain consistent mindfulness or wellness habits that fit his lifestyle.  \n- Maintain positive mood stability and reduce unnecessary worry through evidence-based strategies.

Your parents encouraged independence, especially around academics and work ethic, but rarely spoke openly about emotions. In school, you were socially adept and quick to connect with peers, but in close friendships you sometimes overshared and later wondered if you had revealed too much. Early in college, after a long breakup, you noticed a tendency to loop back in conversations to clarify your reasoning when you felt misunderstood. It wasn’t debilitating then, but it marked the start of a pattern—wanting things to be clear yet becoming more guarded after feeling judged.  \n\nYour first marketing jobs after graduation gave you a sense of purpose and stability. You were optimistic about professional growth, but dating and relationships felt fraught. A few experiences with people dismissing your concerns led you to speak in more general terms about personal matters, especially in new or developing relationships. Around this time, you started feeling more restless before social plans—questioning what you’d say, whether it would come across the wrong way. The anxious energy didn’t stop you from going, but you often left feeling mentally drained.  \n\nAs your career advanced, the work itself remained manageable, but certain meetings stirred persistent worry about how your contributions were perceived. You rehearsed emails several times, circulated back to old points during discussions, and mentally replayed interactions well into the evening. Sleep became lighter and less restorative; you often woke up multiple times and struggled to get moving in the morning.

I got stuck in traffic behind an accident on the highway. Work went ok-- have some good projects. My wife asked me to go to the store after work and I was so tired I didn't want to, but I did anyway. I forgot one of the items she asked for. She was upset about that and I didn't react well. We argued and the kids saw. Not good. I don't usually vent like this"}

You’ve reached a point where the impact on energy, social comfort, and confidence feels too persistent to ignore, and you’re seeking support to ease that anxious edge so it no longer shapes so much of your day.", "chat_username": "US_5_4772895313947411126_regular_2", "chat_password": "US_5_4772895313947411126_regular_2", "argilla_id": "US_5", "intake_summary": "# Reason for Joining & Key Symptoms\n\nPrimary Motivation: Janet joined Dawn to address her ongoing feelings of anxiety and to find ways to better manage her mental and emotional well-being.  \n\nKey Symptoms: Moderate anxiety, dysphoric recent mood, tendency to overthink details, light and disrupted sleep, inconsistent physical activity.  \n\n# Member's Goal\n\nPrimary Goal: Reduce feelings of anxiety, improve sleep quality, and establish a more consistent self-care routine.  \n\n# Medical History & Risk Factors\n\nNo reported medical diagnoses; moderate anxious symptoms present. No physical mobility or breathing limitations identified.  \n\n# Routine & Lifestyle Insights\n\nJanet works full-time as a Marketing Coordinator and lives alone in an urban setting. She maintains an inconsistent exercise routine, with activity occurring in phases. Sleep averages 6-7 hours but is light, interrupted 2-3 times per night, and often followed by hitting the snooze button. She has a few close friends providing strong emotional support. Mood is generally optimistic about career but pessimistic about relationships and personal life. Mindfulness is only practiced sporadically during major life changes.  \n\n# Top 3 Priorities\n\n- Support strategies to manage and reduce anxiety levels.  \n- Improve sleep quality and develop consistent, restorative sleep habits.  \n- Encourage sustainable, low-effort physical activity to boost mood and resilience.

Your father tended toward blunt pragmatism, while your mother emphasized emotional openness, though her moods shifted easily. Being the oldest of three, you absorbed the role of mediator early—checking the temperature of conversations, smoothing over disagreements between your sisters, and quietly adjusting your own tone to keep the peace. At school, you excelled academically but second‑guessed yourself socially, leaning on classmates’ opinions before voicing your own. This careful monitoring of people’s reactions became second nature, especially in mixed cultural settings where you navigated how others perceived you and your racial background.  \n\nIn your twenties, working toward your social work degree gave you a clearer sense of competence in professional settings, yet self‑doubt lingered when decisions weren’t clearly guided by policy or best practice. Marriage brought a few years of stability, but discord grew—disagreements over parenting and long hours spent managing others’ needs left your own overlooked. The divorce in your early thirties reinforced your tendency to focus on keeping relationships cordial, sometimes at the expense of addressing your own frustration. Anxiety during those years showed mostly as over‑preparing for meetings, replaying conversations at night, and scanning for cues that you’d made a misstep.  \n\nMore recently, the balance you once kept between empathy for others and care for yourself has been harder to maintain. The emotional demands of your job feel heavier, and even small conflicts—like a colleague questioning a report—can leave you tense for hours. You remain socially connected to a few close friends, but visits are infrequent, partly due to fatigue and your children’s schedules. Sleep has grown more fitful, with nights of lying awake running through tomorrow’s tasks or yesterday’s slip‑ups. Irritability shows more at home, when repeated questions from your kids or slow household routines trigger sharp replies you regret as soon as they leave your mouth.  \n\nYou’ve noticed that worry now lingers past the moment, feeding into a low mood that makes it harder to start the day or enjoy activities you used to look forward to. Work is still getting done, but you procrastinate on complex cases, relying on last‑minute effort that leaves you drained. Your pessimism about outcomes, once tempered by pleasant surprises, now makes it harder to take initiative in both personal and professional decisions. The uneven sleep, frequent tension, and mental rehearsal of every detail have become constant enough that you no longer feel in control of your baseline anxiety. That recognition—and the wish to interact with others without the undercurrent of stress—has brought you to look for support in reducing its hold on your daily life.", "chat_username": "US_5_5600877072597509645_regular_2", "chat_password": "US_5_5600877072597509645_regular_2", "argilla_id": "US_5", "intake_summary": "# Reason for Joining & Key Symptoms\n\nPrimary Motivation: Angela joined Dawn to address ongoing feelings of anxiety and improve her overall mental well-being.  \n\nKey Symptoms: Irritability, moderate depressive symptoms, moderate anxious symptoms, difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep, low physical activity.\n\n# Member's Goal\n\nPrimary Goal: Reduce feelings of anxiety, improve mood stability, and develop coping strategies for stress.\n\n# Medical History & Risk Factors\nNo reported physical diagnoses impacting mobility or breathing; moderate depressive and anxious symptoms present.\n\n# Routine & Lifestyle Insights\nAngela works full-time as a social worker and lives with her children in an urban setting.
